# Gesture_Mouse_Control_Using_MediaPipe
Control your mouse cursor and clicks using hand gestures detected by a webcam

This project uses OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI to control the mouse cursor and simulate mouse clicks based on hand gestures detected by a webcam. The system tracks hand landmarks, detects finger positions, and maps them to the screen for smooth cursor movement and click events.

## Features
- Hand gesture-based mouse control using a webcam.
- Smooth mouse cursor movement.
- Simulates mouse clicks based on the distance between the index and middle finger.
